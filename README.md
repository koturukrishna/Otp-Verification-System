OTP Generation: Implemented a function to generate a random 6-digit OTP.
Email Simulation: Developed a function to simulate sending the OTP via email.
User Interaction: Created a function to prompt and verify user-entered OTP.
Error Handling: Ensured robust error handling and user-friendly prompts.
Retry Mechanism: Allowed users to retry OTP entry in case of incorrect input.
Deliverables:

Python script for the OTP verification system.
Documentation on functionality and setup.
Test cases for various scenarios.
Optional GUI interface for enhanced user experience.
Tools & Technologies:

Python for scripting and implementation.
SMTP for email simulation.
Optional: Tkinter for GUI development.
Outcome:
Successfully created a reliable and user-friendly OTP verification system, ensuring secure and efficient user authentication.
